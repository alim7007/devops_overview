✅ -i → Keep input open → your keyboard stays connected.
✅ -t → Create a TTY → makes a “screen” inside the container for nice output.
✅ -T → No TTY → skip the “screen” → good for CI pipelines with no real terminal.

👉 Check:

If not running in a real terminal "CI pipeline" → set TTY="-T" → tells docker compose:
“Don’t pretend there’s a terminal — there isn’t one!”



--no-deps is safe here because _dc_run only runs tasks like yarn install and bundle install — they don’t need other containers, so skipping dependencies makes them faster.
